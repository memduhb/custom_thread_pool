# C++ ThreadPool Implementation

A modern C++ thread pool implementation for efficient concurrent task execution. This project demonstrates multi-threading concepts by implementing a fixed-size thread pool that manages worker threads and a thread-safe task queue using condition variables and mutex synchronization.

## Overview

This thread pool implements a producer-consumer pattern with a fixed number of worker threads that continuously process tasks from a shared queue. The implementation uses modern C++ features including `std::thread`, `std::function`, `std::mutex`, and `std::condition_variable` to provide efficient task scheduling and execution. The pool automatically manages thread lifecycle, provides clean shutdown mechanisms, and ensures thread-safe task submission and execution.

## Features

- **Thread Pool Management**: Fixed-size pool of worker threads with automatic lifecycle management
- **Task Queue**: Thread-safe task queuing with condition variable signaling for efficient thread wakeup
- **Modern C++**: Leverages std::thread, std::function, std::mutex, and std::condition_variable
- **Clean Shutdown**: Graceful thread termination with proper cleanup and task completion
- **Thread Safety**: Full thread-safe implementation with mutex protection and atomic operations
- **Performance Optimized**: Tasks executed outside locks to minimize contention
- **Move Semantics**: Efficient task transfer using move semantics
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and edge case management
- **Well Documented**: Comprehensive documentation with clear API and implementation details

## Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates key concepts in concurrent programming and modern C++:

- **Concurrency Control**: Mutex-based synchronization and condition variable signaling
- **Thread Management**: Worker thread creation, lifecycle management, and cleanup
- **Producer-Consumer Pattern**: Task submission and execution with thread-safe queuing
- **Modern C++ Features**: std::thread, std::function, std::mutex, std::condition_variable
- **Memory Management**: RAII principles and automatic resource cleanup
- **Performance Optimization**: Lock contention minimization and efficient task scheduling
- **Thread Safety**: Atomic operations and proper synchronization patterns
- **Error Handling**: Graceful shutdown and edge case management
